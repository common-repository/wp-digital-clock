== Description ==

This is an awesome digital clock that you can use in wp using shortcode. But in one page you can have only one clock for now. If you repeat the shortcode in a page more than one times then it will show only first one. just install it and use the shortcode "[wp_digital_clock]" anywhere in your page and you are done. I am working on it still to give options like change the color of the digit etc. Be connected
